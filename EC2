Documentation: How to Create an EC2 Instance

Step 1: Log in to AWS Management Console
Open the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard by searching for "EC2" in the search bar.

Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance
On the EC2 Dashboard, click on Launch Instance.
Enter the following details:
Name and Tags: Give your instance a meaningful name (e.g., MyWebServer).
AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Select the appropriate AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
Instance Type: Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
Key Pair: Create or select a key pair to securely connect to the instance.
Network Settings: Configure the VPC, subnet, and security group:
Allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) access.
Storage: Configure the storage (e.g., 8 GiB of General Purpose SSD for free tier).
Click Launch Instance to start the EC2 instance.


Step 3: Verify the EC2 Instance
Go back to the Instances section in the EC2 Dashboard.
Verify that your instance is running and note its Public IP Address for connection.


Step 4: Connect to the Instance
Use the public IP address to connect via SSH:

ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip-address>

Replace your-key.pem with your key file and <public-ip-address> with the instanceâ€™s public IP.
